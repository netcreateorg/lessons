# Should I choose this template?

Do you want your students to make connections between historical events and the modern day? Do you want them to see themselves and their community represented in, influenced by, and contrasted against history? The Past to Present network template supports students in making connections between the historical content that they are learning and things they see, do, and know of in their everyday lives by: 
- Break through student’s modern perspective by identifying differences between the present and the historical past
- see connections to people in history by identifying similarities between the present and the historical past

Teachers used this network because students routinely struggled to break through their own modern assumptions to take historical perspective because the cultural and social norms seemed so different.

## When should I use this template?

When you have content from history that has impact on modern life (or on another era in history)

## What sources work best?

- Primary sources from both eras (e.g. images of Roman temples, coins, roads, along with images of modern day architecture that incorporates Roman elements, modern money, modern roads)
- Secondary sources that explain connections between historical eras and modern life

## What's the investment in time and effort for this network?

**Time:** Two class periods: one to add important elements from one historical era and discuss, one to add connected elements from the second historical era and discuss.

**Teacher support:** Teachers will need to
- understand the basics of Net.Create (node and edge entry). [See this basic-data-entry video!](https://netcreate.org)
- how to add images to the network.
- how to toggle between network view and table view and sort columns in table view.
- how to use one network filter (the "?????" filter). [See this ?????-filter video!](https://netcreate.org)
