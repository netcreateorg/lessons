Do you want your students to make connections between historical events and the modern day? Do you want them to see themselves and their community represented in, influenced by, and contrasted against history? The Past to Present network template supports students in making connections between the historical content that they are learning and things they see, do, and know of in their everyday lives by: 
- Break through student’s modern perspective by identifying differences between the present and the historical past
- see connections to people in history by identifying similarities between the present and the historical past

Teachers used this network because students routinely struggled to break through their own modern assumptions to take historical perspective because the cultural and social norms seemed so different.
