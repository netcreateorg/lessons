Do you have a complex text with lots of elements--people, places, things, events--that students struggle to keep track of? This network lets students track the many kinds of connections that are possible in complex literary sources. This network facilitates students to: 
- make connections between elements within a source or topic
- make connections between elements of a source or topic and themselves
- make connections with their peers

Teachers who have used this type of network have created purposeful environments where students were able to see how they are engaged by sharing about themselves and connecting to their learning and peers.

## What's the investment in time and effort for this network?

- How much time will it take?
- What will I need to learn as a teacher to effectively support this lesson?
