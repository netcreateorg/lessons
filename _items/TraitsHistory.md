Do you have a source where you want students to make deeper connections between themselves and historial figures, or between historical figures in sources? The Historical Figure vs. Student network template provides the opportunity to make text-to-self and text-to-text connections in the following ways:
- make connections between themselves and figures from a historical source, specifically focusing on character traits.
- make connections across historical sources.

Teachers who have used this type of network have found it successful for helping students to learn about the traits of historical figures and make connections with the past.
