    Do you have a source where you want students to make deeper connections between themselves and historical figures, or between historical figures in sources? If you want students to explore thematic connections between one or more historical sources and relate them to real-world student experiences, the 'Student Connections to Historical Traits' network template provides the opportunity to make text-to-self and text-to-text connections.
  points:
    - "make connections between historical figures, institutions, and events"
    - "make connections across histories from different time periods and geographies."
    - "make connections between the histories students are studying and their own experiences"
  success: |
    Teachers who have used this type of network have found it successful for helping students to learn about the traits of historical figures, institutions, and phenomenon, and make connections between different time periods and historical institutions.
  bestsources: |
    Sources with historical figures displaying many different character traits--both positive and negative. This activity can be especially helpful for integrating several different readings. Used across several sources, the network can help reinforce or differentiate change and continuity in historical norms.
nodetypes:
  - title: "Historical Figure"
    description: |
      A historical figure, event, institution, etc., from a primary source. For example, when reading about the Roman Empire, a character node might be Julius Caesar (the first Roman emperor).
  - title: "Trait"
    description: |
      A descriptive word or short phrase that characterizes a long-term behavioral, emotional or other trait. For example, Julius Caesar might be described as 'ambitious' in the primary source *The Gallic Wars*. Students might also include notes that further explain the Trait. For example, Julius Caesar's ambition can be seen in his goal to expand Roman Imperial territory.
  - title: "Emotion"
    description: |
      A descriptive word or short phrase that expresses a temporary feeling that happens at a specific moment in the primary source (i.e. an emotion is less long-term than a trait). For example, Julius Caesar describes anger at how the Gauls sacked parts of the Roman Empire but was not angry all the time.
  - title: "Student Experience (optional)"
    description: |
      A short description of a moment in which a student had an experience that aligns with something in the historical source. For example, a student whose ambition is to run a company might connect themselves to 'ambition'.
edgetypeintro: |
  In this network, the edges connect characters or student experiences to traits and emotions that describe the characters or the experience the student had.
edgetypes:
  - title: "is or feels"
    description: |
      In this network, the edges connect historical figures or student experiences to traits and emotions that describe the characters or the experience the student had.
time: |
  From two class periods to many class periods. The first class period gets students used to the network as they identify and enter historical data. Subsequent class periods provide time to revise/add additional historical figures, discuss the historical patterns students see and (for a many-class-period lesson plan) make comparisons across historical time periods and geographies where relevant.
disciplinarylearningoutcomes:
  - outcome: "D2.His.5.6-8"
    description: |
      Explain how and why perspectives of people have changed over time.
  - outcome: "D2.His.4.6-8"
    description: |
      Analyze multiple factors that influenced the perspectives of people during different historical eras.
  - outcome: "D2.His.10.6-8"
    description: |
      Detect possible limitations in the historical record based on evidence collected from different kinds of historical sources.
datalearningoutcomes:
  - outcome: "Data are relational, and hierarchical."
    description: |
      Students will cite the textual evidence that most strongly supports an analysis of what the text says explicitly as well as inferences drawn from the text, including identifying internal conflicts in the data collected from different kinds of historical sources.
  - outcome: "Data are interpreted, and we can even create it."
    description: |
      As we create our data, we may disagree, which impacts interpretation. We need to figure out how to resolve and interpret that.
  - outcome: "Data can be messy."
    description: |
      Students will choose specific character traits and quotes from primary sources and enter them into a network, allowing them to explore their and their peer's interpretation of historical figures' traits in the context of both the original narrative and the data their peers entered. Creating the network themselves can help them appreciate that all visualizations are created by someone with ideas, interests, and biases.
  - outcome: "Data are not always static."
    description: |
      We are changing this data as we discuss our interpretations and revise them.
