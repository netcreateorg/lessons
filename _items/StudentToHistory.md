    **Do you have a complex primary or secondary source with lots of elements--people, places, things, events--that students struggle to keep track of?** When you have a lesson with a barrage of names, dates, and places, and you want students to find one or two connections that will help them better engage with the reading. This network lets students track the many kinds of connections that are possible in complex historical sources.
  points:
    - "make connections between elements within a source or topic"
    - "make connections between elements of a source or topic and themselves"
    - "make connections with their peers"
  success: |
    Teachers who have used this type of network have created purposeful environments where students were able to see how they are engaged by sharing about themselves and connecting to their learning and peers.
  bestsources: |
    Primary sources or secondary sources that have a lot of historical detail and a lot of interaction, with lots of names, dates and places to keep track of.
nodetypeintro: |
  In this network, the nodes represent people, places, objects, groups, and activities that are part of the text or source students are reading and/or are important to the students in the class.
nodetypes:
  - title: "Person"
    description: |
      A person from the text or a student in the class. For example, when studying a source about Greek mythology, a person node might be Zeus (the Greek god) or Adam (a student in the class).
  - title: "Activity"
    description: |
      Something that a person or group of people do. For example, when studying a source about Greek mythology, an activity node might be "a heroic quest".
  - title: "Object"
    description: |
      A physical thing. For example, when studying a source about Greek mythology, an object node might be "lightning bolt".
  - title: "Group"
    description: |
      A group of people. For example, when studying a source about Greek mythology, a group node might be "demigods".
  - title: "Place"
    description: |
      A location or significant place. For example, when studying a source about Greek mythology, a place node might be "the underworld".
edgetypeintro: |
  In this network, the edges show things that are connected. Since the network has both elements of the text or source and elements of real life, nodes from the two should be connected showing relationships between the text or source and the students.
edgetypes:
  - title: "interacts with"
    description: |
      You would use "interacts with" to connect two nodes that have some sort of interaction and an explanation of the interaction. This will likely be a connection between two nodes from the text or source. For example, when studying a source about Greek mythology, there might be an edge showing "Zeus" - "interacts with" - "Hera" with a note saying "Hera is Zeus's wife".
  - title: "connected to"
    description: |
      You would use "connected to" to connect two nodes that are related and provide an explanation of the connection. For example, there might be an edge showing "Hades" - "connected to" - "underworld" and an edge showing "Adam" (a student in the class) - "connected to" - "Apollo" with a note saying "I like music".
time: |
  From one class period to many. This activity is especially helpful for integrating several different readings. Used across several sources, the network can help remind students of previous historical events or figures they encountered months or weeks ago.
disciplinarylearningoutcomes:
  - outcome: "D2.His.5.6-8"
    description: |
      Explain how and why perspectives of people have changed over time.
  - outcome: "D2.His.10.6-8"
    description: |
      Detect possible limitations in the historical record based on evidence collected from different kinds of historical sources.
datalearningoutcomes:
  - outcome: "Data are not always static."
    description: |
      While we sometimes think of history and data both as "static" or unchanging, we often change the data itself as we use it, or through interpretation, or because it describes things that are constantly changing, such as historical norms.
  - outcome: "Data can be messy."
    description: |
      Students will choose specific character traits and quotes from primary sources and enter them into a network, allowing them to explore their and their peer's interpretation of historical figures' traits in the context of both the original narrative and the data their peers entered. Creating the network themselves can help them appreciate that all visualizations are created by someone with ideas, interests, and biases.
  - outcome: "Data sets are built from individual data points."
    description: |
      Students will learn to integrate individual data points and aggregate data patterns. Individual data points may inform certain questions, while patterns within and across datasets help answer others.
