Do you have a source where you want students to make deeper connections between themselves and a character, or between characters in texts? The Character vs. Student network template provides the opportunity to make text-to-self and text-to-text connections in the following ways:
- make connections between themselves and characters from a novel, short story, or other literary work, specifically focusing on character traits.
- make connections across literary works. 

Teachers who have used this type of network have found it successful for helping students to learn about character traits and make connections with literature.
