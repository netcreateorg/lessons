    Allusions are everywhere, from sports broadcasts to remakes. But not all students have the right set of references to find or understand the allusions in the sources they're working with. Are there allusions in literary works that your students are reading that they struggle to identify? Do you want to support them as they learn more about both familiar and unfamiliar allusions in their reading? The Allusions network template helps students to:
  points:
    - "make connections between themselves and characters from a novel, short story, or other literary work, specifically focusing on character traits."
    - "make connections across literary works."
  success: |
    Teachers who have used this type of network have found it successful for helping students work with one source that has unfamiliar references that connect to other readings.
  bestsources: |
    Sources that are influenced by something else or have lots of references that students need to track. For example, *The Looking Glass Wars* is built on the framework from Lewis Carroll's *Alice in Wonderland*; Shakespeare plays often use biblical references; Percy Jackson uses Greek mythology as its starting point.
nodetypeintro: |
  In this network, the nodes represent the allusions identified within the work and who those allusions are aimed at.
nodetypes:
  - title: "Allusion"
    description: |
      A quote that has a built-in reference to something else. For example, if we were reading *The Looking Glass Wars* (a 21st-century adaptation of *Alice in Wonderland*), we would enter “Alyss,” the name of the main character.
  - title: "Example"
    description: 'The reference. If our allusion is Alyss from The Looking Glass Wars, then we''d enter "Alice in Alice in Wonderland."'
  - title: "Audience"
    description: |
      The audience who would understand either the Allusion or the Example. For example, the audience for Alyss would be “21st-century Young Adults."
edgetypeintro: |
  In this network, the edges connect allusions to their original sources and to the audiences for both allusions and original sources.
edgetypes:
  - title: "Builds on"
    description: |
      We'd use "Builds On" to connect the “Alyss” Looking Glass Wars node to the "Alice Wonderland" node.
  - title: "Relates to"
    description: |
      We'd use "Relates To" to connect the "People in 19th-century England" node to the “Alice in Wonderland” node to indicate that Alice in Wonderland was originally aimed at 19th-century English audiences.
time: |
  Two class periods. One to get students used to the network as they identify and enter allusions and their sources. The second class period provides time to revise/add additional allusions and discuss the patterns students see in the allusions they entered.
disciplinarylearningoutcomes:
  - outcome: "CCSS.ELA-Literacy.RL.8.4"
    description: |
      Determine the meaning of words and phrases as they are used in a text, including figurative and connotative meanings; analyze the impact of specific word choices on meaning and tone, including analogies or allusions to other texts.
  - outcome: "CCSS.ELA-Literacy.RL.8.9"
    description: |
      Analyze how a modern work of fiction draws on themes, patterns of events, or character types from myths, traditional stories, or religious works such as the Bible, including describing how the material is rendered new.
datalearningoutcomes:
  - outcome: "Data are interpreted, and we can even create it."
    description: |
      Students will choose specific allusions that connect sources and enter them into a network, allowing them to explore their and their peer's interpretation of sources that refer to each other. Creating the network themselves can help them appreciate that all visualizations are created by someone with ideas, interests, and biases.
  - outcome: "Data sets are built from individual data points."
    description: |
      Students will learn to integrate individual data points and aggregate data patterns. Individual data points may inform certain questions, while patterns within and across datasets help answer others.
