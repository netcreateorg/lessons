Data is information that was collected and organized for a reason. When we interpret data we should be mindful that the way the data was collected, organized, and presented can change how we might interpret it. While data is often associated with math and science, it can also be used to make sense of patterns in literature, history, and really any subject!



## CONTEXT
Where does this data come from?
Who created this, and what might they have been focused on?
How does the source influence how we read it?
How are we using this data and for what?
Does that change how we should interpret it?

## AGGREGATION
What patterns do we see in our data as a whole?
How do individual data points look similar or different from that pattern? What might that mean?

## VARIABILITY
How different are our data points? 
What do these differences really mean?

## VISUALIZATION
How do the different ways of looking at this data change what we see?


## INFERENCE
What do we think this means, and how do we know?
Does this visualization include other assumptions and do  we agree?
